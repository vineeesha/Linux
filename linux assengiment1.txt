1)Explain file system hierarchy in linux system?
ans)All there are apper under the root directory/, even they are stored on different physical or
virtual devices.
/bin/:In this all the binary information is stored.
/boot/:These directory contains static files required to boot the system, such as the Linux 
       kernel. These files are essential for the system to boot properly.
/dev/:These  directory contains file system entries which represent devices that are attached 
      to the system. These files are essential for the system to function properly.
/etc/:These directory is reserved for configuration files that are local to the machine. No 
      binaries are to be placed in /etc/. Any binaries that were once located in /etc/ should 
      be placed into /sbin/ or /bin/.
/lib/:These directory should contain only those libraries needed to execute the binaries in 
      /bin/ and /sbin/.
/media/:directory contains subdirectories used as mount points for removeable media, such as 3.5 
        diskettes, CD-ROMs, and Zip disks.
/mnt/:These directory is reserved for temporarily mounted file systems, such as NFS file system 
      mounts. For all removeable media, use the /media/ directory.
/opt/:directory provides storage for large, static application software packages.
/proc/:These directory contains special files that either extract information from or send 
       information to the kernel.
/sbin/:These directory stores executables used by the root user. The executables in /sbin/ are 
       only used at boot time and perform system recovery operations. 
/srv/:directory contains site-specific data served by your system running Red Hat Enterprise 
      Linux. 
/sys/:These directory utilizes the new sysfs virtual file system specific to the 2.6 kernel. 
       With the increased support for hot plug hardware devices in the 2.6 kernel, the /sys/ 
       directory contains information similarly held in /proc/, but displays a hierarchical 
       view of specific device information in regards to hot plug devices.
/usr/: directory is for files that can be shared across multiple machines.

2)what is mkdir command & option -v,-p,-m command?

10)Which user acount is created on linux while installation?
ans)It is created for system admin account called root and the password you entered during
installation is for root user.

11)What is the use of file command?
ans)These file command is used to determine a file type.
  file *  this will apper when running file with a wildcard for all files.
(or) file *.txt  this will display the file ending with .txt.

   find file in the current directory
#find /home -name filename
   find filename in home directory
#find / -name filename
   find filename in all directory
#find . -type f -name "*.php"
   find all php files in current directory.

 umask u=rwx , g= ,o=

18)How to set permissions for files and directories?
ans)#chmod 777 filename
  give 777 permissions for file
#chmod +rwx file.txt
  read write execute for all i.e user,group,other
#chmod u+rw file.txt
  read write for only user

ans)System load/CPU Load – is a measurement of CPU over or under-utilization in a Linux system; 
the number of processes which are being executed by the CPU or in waiting state. Load average –
is the average system load calculated over a given period of time of 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

23)what is partial backup?
ans)

24)when you select single partition for single folder for backup on your server?
ans)

25)What is boot process in linux?
ans)The boot process for Linux goes through several stages. Different systems follows different
stage here in Linux have 6 stages of Boot.
1.BIOS ( Basic Input/Output System )
2.MBR ( Master boot Record )
3.GRUB ( Grand Unified Boot Loader )
4.Kernel
5.init
6.run level ( init 0?—?init 6 )
BIOS : The term BIOS stands for “Basic I/O System”, It looks for boot loader in CD Rom, hdd, or 
other boot-able media. Once the boot loader is detected and loaded into memory, BIOS gives the 
control to it.So in simple terms we can say that “BIOS loads and executes the MBR boot loader “
MBR : The term MBR stands for “Master boot records” it is located in the first sector of the 
boo-table disks like /dev/hda or /dev/sda , And it has three component and MBR is less than or 
equal to 512 Bytes in size
Primary boot loader info in 1st 446 bytes
Partition table info in next 64 bytes.
MBR validation check in last 2 bytes.
so, we can say that, MBR loads(Boot info) and execute the GRUB boot loader.
GRUB : As mention above the term GRUB stands for “Grand unified boot loader” , if we have 
multiple images installed on our system we can choose one to be execute, GRUB display a splash 
screen, waits for few seconds, if you don’t enter or press anything, it loads the default Kernel
image as specified in the GRUB Configuration file.
Kernel : The term Kernel is the core of an operating system which provides access to services 
and hardware. So the boot loader loads one or multiple “initramfs images” into system memory. 
[ initramfrs: initial RAM Disk], The kernel use “initramfs”to read drivers and needed modules 
for booting the system. And it mount the “root file system” as specified in the ‘root=(GRUB 
configuration file).
init : During this process, the system locates the root partition and file system. Both are 
checked and mounted then the system start the init process. Which runs the initialization 
scripts invoking different scripts in the “/etc/rc*.d “ directory. so we can say that init 
execute run level program.so init execute the Run level program (init 0- init 6) depend on the 
default init level settings, system will execute. Look at the /etc/init tab following are the 
available run level “/etc/init.d/rc.*d”
Run level : When the Linux System booting up, Those are the run level programs execute from the 
run level directory or defined by your run level directory.

26)How can we review boot message?
ans)#dmesg or #dmesg |more (for page vise view)
The dmesg command displays the system messages contained in the kernel ring buffer. By using 
this command immediately after booting your computer, you will see the boot messages.

27)What are the fields in the/etc/passwd file?
ans)Traditionally, the /etc/passwd file is used to keep track of every registered user that has 
access to a system.The /etc/passwd file is a colon-separated file that contains the following 
information:
User name
Encrypted password
User ID number (UID)
User's group ID number (GID)
Full name of the user (GECOS)
User home directory
Login shell

28)How to check which RPM provides/etc/shadow file?
ans)# rpm -q --whatprovides [file name]
Here file name is /etc/shadow. if we want to check which rpm provides a /etc/hosts 
#rpm -q --whatprovides /etc/hosts
# yum whatprovides [file_name]. this is also for finding rpm by using yum command.

29)In which file the password are saved for each user?
ans)

30)In which file user information is saved?
ans)Every user on a Linux system, whether created as an account for a real human being or 
associated with a particular service or system function, is stored in a file called 
"/etc/passwd". The "/etc/passwd" file contains information about the users on the system.

31)What is Inode? What is the use? 
ans)An inode is a data structure used to keep information about a file on your hosting account.
The number of inodes indicates the number of files and folders you have.This includes everything
on your account, emails, files, folders, anything you store on the server.

32)/etc/resolve.configExplain and if we not declared here what will happen?
ans)

33)What is Vcpu,if vcpu% more than 1 what will happen?
ans)A vCPU stands for virtual central processing unit. One or more vCPUs are assigned to every 
Virtual Machine (VM) within a cloud environment. Each vCPU is seen as a single physical CPU core
by the VM's operating system.

34)How you will find out  memory details and explain about swap memory?
ans)

35)Write a command for 5 days older files with extension of .log ,those files want to move it 
different directory?
ans)

36)What is Inode? What is the useof Inode? 
ans)An inode is an entry in inode table. containing information about regular file and directory
An inode is a data structure used to keep information about a file on your hosting account. the
number of inode indicates the number of files and folders you have these includes everything on
your account, emails,files,floders,anything you store on the server.

37)Booting process? Explain about run levels? what is default run levels?
ans)

38)How will you find out top ten process?
ans)

39)How to check the CPU utilization?
ans) mpstat (or) iostat (or) top (or)cat /proc/cpuinfo

40)Difference between Top/HTop?
ans)top is reporting the first line of free -m which is basically RAM that is completely empty.
htop is reporting from the 2nd segment of free -m which is basically the RAM that might have non
-important stuff loaded into it right now, and could be free'd up automatically if any 
applications actually needed it.


41)Directory special permissions?
ans)

42)What is soft link and hard link? How to create? What is the difference between these two?
ans)Hard Link acts like a mirror copy of the original file. These links share the same inodes. 
Changes made to the original or hard linked file will reflect in the other. When you delete Hard
Link nothing will happen to the other file. Hard links can't cross file systems.
Soft Link is an actual link to the original file. These Links will have a different Inodes value
Soft link points to the original file so if the original file is deleted then the soft link 
fails. If you delete the Soft Link, nothing will happen to file. The reason for this is, the 
actual file or directory’s inode is different from the "soft link" created file's inodes. Soft 
links can cross file systems.
hard soft link difference linux
What are Hard Links
1. Hard Links have same inodes number.
2. ls -l command shows all the links with the link column showing the number of links.
3. Links have actual file contents
4. Removing any link, just reduces the link count but doesn't affect the other links.
5. You cannot create a Hard Link for a directory.
6. Even if the original file is removed, the link will still show you the contents of the file.
What are Soft Links
1. Soft Links have different inodes numbers.
2. ls -l command shows all links with second column value 1 and the link points to the original file.
3. Soft Link contains the path for original file and not the contents.
4. Removing soft link doesn't affect anything but when the original file is removed, the link
becomes a 'dangling' link that points to nonexistent file.
5. A Soft Link can link to a directory.

43)What is cron tab? Explain it? How to configure the schedule a job?
ans)Cron allows Linux and Unix users to run commands or scripts at a given date and time. You 
can schedule scripts to be executed periodically. Cron is one of the most useful tool in a Linux
 or UNIX like operating systems. It is usually used for sysadmin jobs such as backups or 
cleaning /tmp/ directories and more.
Crontab Commands
export EDITOR=vi ;to specify a editor to open crontab file.
crontab -e    Edit crontab file, or create one if it doesn’t already exist.
crontab -l    crontab list of cronjobs , display crontab file contents.
crontab -r    Remove your crontab file.
crontab -v    Display the last time you edited your crontab file. (This option is only available
on a few systems.)
Crontab file
Crontab syntax :
A crontab file has five fields for specifying day , date and time followed by the command to be 
run at that interval.
1.Minutes specified as a number from 0 to 59.
2.Hours specified as numbers from 0 to 23.
3.Days of the month, specified as numbers from 1 to 31.

and 7.

44)Explan about Process and threads?
Ans)A process is an excecuying program. one or more trhreads run in the context of a process. A 
thread is the basic unit to which the o.s allocates processer time. a thread can excute any part
of the process code, including parts currently being excuted by another thread.

ans)

55)What is sed command?
Ans)SED command in UNIX is stands for stream editor and it can perform lot's of function on file 
like, searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. Though most common use of SED command 
in UNIX is for substitution or for find and replace.
The following sed one-liner will return lines 5 through 10 from myfile.txt:
# sed -n '5,10p' myfile.txt
To exclude lines 20 through 35 from myfile.txt, do:
# sed '20,35d' myfile.txt
Let’s display lines 5-7 and 10-13 from myfile.txt:
# sed -n -e '5,7p' -e '10,13p' myfile.txt
To replace every instance of the word version with story in myfile.txt, do:
# sed 's/version/story/g' myfile.txt
If you’re interested in replacing words only within a line range (30 through 40, for example), 
you can do:
# sed '30,40 s/version/story/g' myfile.txt
To remove empty lines or those beginning with # from the Apache configuration file, do:
# sed '/^#\|^$\| *#/d' httpd.conf

56)What is AWK command
Ans)Awk stands for Aho Weinberger and Kernighan. Awk is a scripting language to process and 
analyze files. Some of the features of Awk are given below :
Mehedi	01	WDE	25000
Arafat	02	WDE	27000
Baki	03	SDE	30000
Mahbub	04	ADE	29000
Nazmul	05	SDE	24000
If action has pattern , then matches that pattern with files line by line until end of file and 
print the matches lines. Example :
#awk '$4>=25000  {print $1, $2 }' in.txt
Output are given below
Mehedi 01
Arafat 02
Baki 03
Mahbub 04

57)What is grep and egrep?
Ans)I have played around with grep for a while, at some point I have noticed egrep. grep and 
egrep does the same function, but the way they interpret the pattern is the only difference.
#ls | grep '.txt|.php'
Let us consider this example, in this we are listing all the files in the present working 
directory. Using pipe we are passing the output of ls to grep. The grep command will check 
whether there is any file with .text|.php extension.
#ls | egrep '.txt|.php'
Now consider the same example with egrep, here egrep will check for files with either .txt or 
.php extension. By using egrep we can even search for multiple pattern, files at a time using 
one command. We can make grep also do the same by escaping the characters.

58)How to list out the only directories in a Linux?

61)What is ping? Telnet? Curl? wget?
ans)ping:The ping command is usually used as a simple way to verify that a computer can 
          communicate over the network with another computer or network device. The ping command 
          operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request messages to 
          the destination computer and waiting for a response.
telnet:check connectivityy and check port numbers is their or not.
wget:it is used for non-interactive network downloaders

62)How to check the services in Linux machine?
Ans)

63)How to kill the process in Linux?
Ans)#kill -9 pid (or) kill -3 pid
    we can find the pid by using the ps -ef

64)What is nice and renice?
Ans)"nice" is used for starting new processes that are biased to run with more or less CPU.
The "nice value" is more or less a "process priority". The range is from -20 at its highest to
19 at its lowest. ... "renice" is for changing the "nice" factor on a process that's already 
running.

65)How to get the java thread dump?
Ans)Request a thread dump from the JVM
1.To obtain a thread dump using jstack, run the following command: jstack -l <pid>
2.You can output consecutive thread dumps to a file by using the console output redirect/append 
directive: jstack -l <pid> >> threaddumps.log.

66)How to check the running ports?
Ans)netstat -tupln

67)How to trouble shoot the remote server having some issue?
Ans)

68)What is cloud concept?
ans)cloud is pay-as-u-go. Cloud – The technology of distributed data processing in which some 
scalable information resources and capacities are provided as a service to multiple external 
customers through Internet technology. ... Customers also have the opportunity of paid use of
it, usually through the Internet.
there are three types of cloud types1.
1)IAAS:infrastructure as a service. It provides only the hardware device.
2)PAAS:platform as a service.It provides the hardware as well as software for running the app.
when we install a software then it will work.
3)SAAS:software as a service.in the the application also installed. here we no nead to install 
application.

69)if i am debugging the already existing script written by someone one and it is a huge one and i am 
not sure of the lines where error may occur, is there any method to find out what is the error apart 
from running script in debug mode?
ans)no, we are not finding where the error is present.
